Contractvm
======================================

Contractvm is a general-purpose decentralized framework based on blockchain. The framework is extensible through a 
plugin infrastructure that allows to implement arbitrary decentralized applications (dapps) in an easy way, 
providing the necessary abstraction layer. In contrast to existing solutions, contractvm doesn't verify 
computation state of dapps, proposing a client-side consensus mechanism for mitigating malicious behaviours.
